This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Built using [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) and [Unstated](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated).

## Challenge
This is a simple todo app with the ability to create todos and mark them as complete.
The problem with this app is that it is too simple and it is missing some features!
Right now we only have one list showing with all its todos there, and we canâ€™t create new lists, and we can't filter todos.
For your test, you need to add:

1. The ability to filter the todos between "completed", "active" or "all"
2. Create new lists and show all of the lists of todos. When opening any list, it will then show the items of the list.
3. Optional: add tests where you think they're needed, especially for the store.js file. Feel free to refactor things to make testing easier.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
